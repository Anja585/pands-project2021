# Introduction
This README file presents the research methodology and outcomes to the final project for the Programming and Scripting module as a part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics) at GMIT. 

The topic of the research project is the Iris flower data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Students were given deliberately vague instructions on how to tackle the project with the intention to come with their own ideas. We will be mainly focusing on descriptive statistics.
