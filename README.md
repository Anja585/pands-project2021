# Introduction
This README file presents the research methodology and outcomes to the final project for the Programming and Scripting module as a part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics) at GMIT. 

The topic of the research project is the Iris flower data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Students were given deliberately vague instructions on how to tackle the project with the intention to come with their own ideas. We will be mainly focusing on descriptive statistics. 
# Iris flower data set
Iris flower data set (sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set by Edgar Anderson who collected the data) consists of 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant - *iris setosa, iris versicolor, iris virginica*.
The attributes measured were: 
* sepal length
* sepal width
* petal length
* petal width. 

All measures were given in centimeters. The Iris flower data set is now widely used as a data set for testing purposes in computer science. Below is an image of each flower type and a summary of samples presented in a table.
